- The Client-Server Architecture tells you about Servers, Connection between a client and the server and how it takes place.
- The client-server network is usually scaled large across countries and even continents.

## 1 . Client & Server
**Servers**
- Points on the network that provide a server. Clients connect to the servers/
- Servers are the points where a client connects to have a connection for getting/providing a service, to do some task, etc.
- The servers have high upload speed because of what they need to do and their nature.
- The servers of big companies are distributed and they usually do not have only a single server.

**Clients**
- Client is us, who connects to the server for doing a task or for getting a service.
- Clients have high download speed (as compared to the upload speed).
- When `Client A` wants to connect to `Client B`, then this connection takes place only through the server, i.e. Gaming.

*Data Center* -> Collection of huge number of computers (servers) 


## 2. Peer to Peer (p2p)

- Devices connected to one another and there is no large (main) server in this architecture
- As it is decentralized (no central server) ,  hence easy to scale
- Every device works as server and client.
- Peer to peer networking can be more effective than client server networking because every computer on the network is given equal responsibility to communicate with each other.
Example -> BitTorrent

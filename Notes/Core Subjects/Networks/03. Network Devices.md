### 1 . Repeater
- Operates at the physical layer.
- This device takes the network signal and sends it again in the desired direction before the signal becomes weak over the same network.
- Used to extend the length to which the signal can be transmitted over the same network.
- These don't amplify the network but they regenerate the detected network with the same strength.
- They regenerate the network by copying signal bit by bit .
- 2 port device
### 2 . Hub
- A multiport repeater.
- Cannot filter data , and hence the data packets are sent to all connected devices . "Collision domain of all hosts connected through hub is 1"
- ***Collision domain*** : A collision domain isÂ **a network segment that is shared but not bridged or switched**; packets collide because users are sharing the same bandwidth.
- Do not have intelligence to find the best past for data packers which leads to inefficiencies and wastage.
  #### Types
  1.  ***Active Hub*** : - This has its own power supply and can clean, boost and relay the given network. Used to extend maximum distance between two nodes.
  2. ***Passive Hub*** : - This takes power from the connected wires. This sends the network from the wire without clean and boosting the network.
